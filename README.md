# Statistical-Analysis-of-a-Diabetes-Dataset
Statistical analysis of a diabetes dataset using Excel, including descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, ANOVA, and multiple linear regression.
# Project Overview

This project analyzes a small diabetes-related dataset using Microsoft Excel.
The goal is to apply statistical methods such as descriptive analysis, hypothesis testing, ANOVA, and multiple linear regression to understand relationships between gender, height, weight, and catheter length.

# Dataset Description

The dataset contains 20 observations with these variables:

Gender (1 = Female, 2 = Male)

Height (inches)

Weight (pounds)

Catheter Length (cm)

# Methods Used

Descriptive statistics: mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis

Visualizations: histogram and boxplot

Two-sample t-test: compare catheter length between genders

One-way ANOVA: test if clothing color affects perceived intelligence

Multiple linear regression: predict catheter length using gender, height, and weight

# Key Findings

No significant difference in catheter length between males and females.

Clothing color does not significantly affect perceived intelligence ratings.

Regression model explains 83.55% of catheter length variability,
but no individual predictor is statistically significant.

Height, weight, and gender do not meaningfully predict catheter length in this sample.
